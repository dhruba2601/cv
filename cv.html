    <h3>About</h3>   
    <p>My research for solving problem encourage me to pursue engineering for my diploma and bachelor's.
        My idol is my uncle once said" Do something different then other.forget those fear in you try once to overcome those fear once you cross it. The road is yours" and " teach(what you learn)and give ( what you have)"
        Going to college for 6 hours and then hustle for 3 hours. But great things hustle experience is great. This hustle shape me in a way I could have never been imagined. Eventually,we built the largest community of engineering in Guwahati.
        
        I also realised that I have a good teach skill by the fact that I was able to reach these students without any advertisement or pay.
        with a keen interest in plastic production and programming skillset ,I want to give my best shot at my bringing value to ther world.
        feel free to drop in message if any help. I'm always happy to help.</p>
